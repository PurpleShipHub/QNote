Room 541276 — The Broken Clock
He stepped into the next room.
The air was still.
The light, colder.

A tall clock stood against the wall.
Its hands weren’t moving.

He walked closer.
There was no glass.
Just gears. Still and dry.

The time on the face:

8:39

It hadn’t ticked in years.
But the moment looked frozen.
Important.

Beside the clock sat a metal plate.
Etched into it:

“Train Platform 2”

Suddenly, the floor buzzed beneath his feet.
And a faint sound filled the air—
A train horn, far away.

His hands reached for the gears.
They wouldn’t turn.

Then, he looked lower.
A train ticket.
Old. Folded.

He opened it.
It read:

Train No. 4
Gate: 02

He looked back at the clock.

8:39
Train 4
Gate 02

He didn’t need more.
He already knew the number.

He whispered it.

And the door opened.
