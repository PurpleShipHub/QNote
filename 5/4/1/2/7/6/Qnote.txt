🔐 The House With the Waiting Window
Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆☆

The room resembled a home.
But it felt like a replica—an echo of something real.

Wooden floorboards, uneven and worn.
A single armchair.
A small clock on the wall.
Its hands pointed slightly past four.

The window faced west.
Sunlight filtered through soft curtains.
A ghost of warmth clung to the corner.

On the table, a letter:

“Five minutes after four.
The moment you stopped coming.
The house at the end.
One two seven six.”

He touched the glass.
It was cold.

He didn’t look back.
