🔐 The House With the Waiting Window
Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆☆

The door creaked behind him.
Wood floors. Yellow walls.
Smell of dust and sunlight.

A clock ticked slowly.
She used to wait at this time.
Every day. Every day. Until she didn’t.

“Five past four,” she once said.
“That’s when the light hits your chair.”
“We lived at the end. Last house. Number 1276.”

He walked to the window.
Empty street.
No one watching anymore.

He turned away.
And left.
