🔐 The Letter Unopened
Difficulty: ★★★★☆☆

This room smelled like paper.
Old. Yellowing. Familiar.

A desk stood against the far wall.
A sealed envelope rested on top.
He recognized the handwriting.

Inside was a letter.
Short. Personal. Intentional.

“One day, you’ll forget me.”
“Two minutes later, you’ll remember.”
“Zero distance. Eight truths I never told.”
“Four regrets.”
“Five I still carry.”

He traced the lines with his finger.
Folded it again.
And placed it into his coat.

He didn’t read it twice.
He had it memorized.
