🔐 The Letter Unopened
Difficulty: ★★★★☆☆

A desk.
A single envelope.
Yellowed edges. Never sent.

The letter read:

“One day, you’ll forget me.”
“Two minutes later, you’ll remember.”
“Zero distance.”
“Eight things I never said.”
“Four I regret.”
“Five I’d still say.”

He folded it slowly.
His fingers shook.
But he placed it in his pocket.
And walked on.
