DEMOGRAPHIC DATA

Name: Espejo, M. J. 
Address:  Caloocan, Quezon City
Age/Gender: 67 / Male
Occupation:  Retired
Referring Unit:  Coronary Care Unit (EAC Memorial Medical Center)
Referring MD: Marina Benipayo MD
Date of Referral: December 7, 2020
Date of Initial Evaluation: December 7, 2020
Medical Diagnosis: s/p coronary artery bypass graft


SUBJECTIVE
Chief Complaint: Patient complains of pain on chest suture site especially when coughing (described as “parang napupunit ang dibdib”); VRS 7/10 on coughing, 2/10 at rest.


Goals and Attitude Towards Therapy: Patient hopes to return to driving and his usual hobbies such as carpentry, attending to pet fish and pet dog and gardening; and that he will no longer be bothered by pain on his chest suture site.
 
History of Present Illness: (informant: Mr. M. J. E.; reliability: good)

	4 weeks prior to IE, patient was brought to the Emergency Room of Emilio Aguinaldo College Medical Center due to complaints of “massive chest pain”.  Electrocardiography and other blood tests revealed an ongoing heart attack of the unstable angina kind (see Ancillary Procedures). Patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for management and monitoring of the condition. Echocardiography done two days after admission revealed below normal ejection fraction.  Patient was subsequently referred for angiography.  This was done 4 days after admission, and revealed occlusion of coronary circulation at 6 sites. Patient was scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), having to wait for the availability of the surgeons and the operating room.  One week after admission, when patient was already ambulatory and without any more attachments, patient was discharged.

	Two weeks after the initial admission, patient was readmitted at the Emilio Aguinaldo College Medical Center for his scheduled CABG.  Quadruple bypass was done. Patient stayed in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for 2 days and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Ward after.  Patient was then referred to PT for Phase I of Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Program, which consisted of ROM exercises, ankle pumps, incentive spirometry and ambulation within ward as tolerated.  

	Patient was discharged 1 week post-CABG and referred for Phase II of Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Program.  One week after discharge, patient reported to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine to begin Phase II of the cardiac rehabilitation program.

Treadmill Stress Test: Using the Bruce protocol, the patient was able to tolerate 4 METS. Pt. exercised for 8 minutes reaching a target heart rate of 128 beats per minute. Ten minutes into exercise, his ST segments began elevating in the inferior leads. He therefore had an acute inferior infarct. His stress test was stopped. He complained of vague chest pain.
