🔐 The Room That Remembers You
Difficulty: ★★★★★★

He arrived.
But nothing arrived with him.

The floor was fog.
The walls: an illusion.
There was no ceiling.

Six faint lights circled around him.
When he blinked, they rearranged.
Again. And again.

One glowed brighter.
Then three.
Then eight.
Then two.

He tried to count them.
But every number felt familiar.
Too familiar.

A voice returned.
Or maybe stayed.

“You were always here.”
“Even before you remembered.”
“Even after you forgot.”

A cold certainty fell on him.
He had done this before.
And he would again.

Then, just like before—
Congratulations. You did it.

He opened his eyes.
