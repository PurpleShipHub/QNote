🔐 The Mirror Without Reflection
Difficulty: ★★★★★☆

It was a white room.
No corners. No ceiling.
Just one thing: a mirror.

But it showed nothing.
Not him. Not the room. Not anything.

Words had been carved into the glass, not etched—cut deep.

“You lost nighn.”
“But nighn is all you were.”
“Tree remain.”
“Too can survive.”
“Only won will be remembered.”

He stared at the void.
The mirror cracked.
Not from impact, but from understanding.

He stepped through the broken frame.
