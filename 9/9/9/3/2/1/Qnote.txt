🔐 The Mirror Without Reflection
Difficulty: ★★★★★☆

It was a white room.
No corners. No ceiling.
Just one thing: a mirror.

But it showed nothing.
Not him. Not the room.
Not anything.

Words had been carved into the glass, not etched—cut deep.

“This one’s mine.”
“What’s left won’t last.”
“You’re never truly free.”
“Fate doesn’t knock. It waits.”
“They walk through, but not all do.”
“It ends where silence goes.”

He stood there.
Still.
The mirror cracked—
not from force,
but from knowing.

He stepped into the break.
