Room 839402 — The Platform Below
The floor beneath him tilted.

He stumbled, but didn’t fall.
Just down.
The hallway had become a ramp.

At the end, a door waited.
Heavy. Rusted.

A note was pinned to it.
Ripped.
Faded.

“Trains run on four tracks now.
Board the third one.
Second gate.
Don’t miss it this time.”

He blinked.

He had missed something once.
Someone, maybe.
The memory trembled at the edge.

He pushed the door open.

Metal walls.
Yellow lights.
A waiting room.

Three benches.
One empty.
Two occupied—by shadows that didn’t move.

He stepped around them.
A suitcase lay by the far bench.
Tag still attached.

“For Eli. 4th Car, 2nd Row.”

The ground rumbled.
He ran to the far side.

Six shoes by the platform’s edge.
One pair had red laces.

He didn’t know why—
but he followed the red ones.

And the door opened again.
