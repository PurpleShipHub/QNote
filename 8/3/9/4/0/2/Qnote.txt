🔐 The Platform Below
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆☆

A station. No passengers.
Only metal. And silence.

Three benches.
One empty—his.
A suitcase with a torn tag.

“To Eli. Fourth car. Second row.”

He looked down the tunnel.
The red light blinked once.
Twice.
Three times.

He walked past two closed gates.
The third one opened.

He didn’t wait for the train.
