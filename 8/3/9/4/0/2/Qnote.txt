🔐 The Platform Below
Difficulty: ★★★☆☆☆

Metal walls.
Dim lights.
A train station, but hollow—too quiet.

Three benches lined the platform.
One was empty.
Two held vague shadows.

On the middle bench sat a suitcase.
A tag still clung to the handle:

“To: E. Cross”
“Car 4. Seat 2.”

He looked up.
Above the gates, three numbers flickered.

The first and second were dark.
Only the third glowed faintly.

He didn’t need to read it.
He knew which gate was his.

The ground vibrated.
He walked toward the light.
