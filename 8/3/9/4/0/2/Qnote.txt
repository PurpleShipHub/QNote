Difficulty: ★★★☆☆☆
Code to enter Room 4: 029384

The hallway led to an underground station.
But there were no trains.

Just a timetable.

Platform 8 — 3:09 departure
Platform 4 — 2:04 arrival
Platform 2 — “Status: Cancelled”

A loudspeaker cracked on.
“This is the final boarding call for you.”

He stepped toward platform four.
His foot hit something.
A ticket.

It read:
“092-384. Last ride home.”

He looked up.
There was no ceiling.
