🔐 The Door That Hears
Difficulty: ★★★★☆☆

The station dissolved.
He was alone in the dark.

A single door stood there.
No handle. No hinges.

Words echoed around him.
But none were spoken.

“You had three chances.”
“You used them all.”
“But still... we wait.”

A keypad beside the door lit up.
It pulsed like a heartbeat.

A sign:
“Attempt #999”

A whisper followed:
“Three two one... go.”

He didn’t press anything.
But the door opened.
