The Candle That Shouldn’t Burn
Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆☆

Congratulations. You did it.
That was the first thing he heard.
It didn’t feel true.
It didn’t feel like now.

The room was small, square, and made of stone.
No doors. No windows. Just stillness.

At the center, a birthday cake.
Six candles. Five untouched.
Only the third had melted.

A matchbox lay nearby.
Inside: nothing.
On the back: a series of etched numbers, rough and deliberate.

The cake read:

"Happy Birthday, Eli. You are ten now."

His fingers moved toward the third candle.
He pressed it down.
A soft click echoed from the wall.

One slab of stone retracted.
A narrow hallway appeared.

Next to the opening:
Faint words, carved into metal:

“5:41 PM”
“House No. 1276”

Something stirred in him.
A window. A warm chair. Someone always waiting.

And then no one.

He stepped through.
