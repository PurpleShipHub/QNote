The Candle That Shouldn’t Burn
Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆☆

He opened his eyes.
Stone. Cold. Still.

A birthday cake on a table.
Six candles.
Only the third had melted.

A matchbox.
Scratched in:

28.09.10

The cake said:

“Happy Birthday, Eli. You are ten now.”

He touched the third candle.
A click.
A slow groan from the wall.

Inside: a hallway.
A time.
A place.
A memory.

He stepped forward.
