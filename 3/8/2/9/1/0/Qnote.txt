Room 382910 — The Candle That Shouldn’t Burn
He opened his eyes.
Cold floor. Stone walls. No sound.

A small cake sat on a table.
Six candles. Five clean. One melted—the third.

He saw a matchbox.
No matches inside. Just a number, scratched in:

28.09.10

The cake had a message.
“Happy Birthday, Eli. You are ten now.”

The name felt familiar.
Like someone whispered it long ago.

He touched the melted candle.
It sank. Click.

A wall moved.
A hallway appeared.

On the stone beside it:

5:41 PM
House No. 1276

His chest tightened.
He remembered the window.
And someone always waiting.

He stepped through.
